## Machine Learnning Trading Bots

Using Machine Learning, we are trying to configure a model to judge whether or not to use on Algorithmic Trading

Baseline performance metrics using SVC classifier model from SKLearn's SVM learning method:

changing the parameters of the short and long window on the base metric model seems to smooth out the graph of actual vs strategic returns

Trying out a new model to see if it fits the data better and can make a more accurate prediction.
The focus of choosing a model is based on less negative downsides rather than gains

The baseline model seems to have a more steady prediction of the relationship between the strategic and actual returns
